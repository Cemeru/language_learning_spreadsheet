# 🌍 Multilingual Language Learning Sheets

This is a structured system for learning languages through example sentences and spreadsheet automation. Each sheet is optimized for sentence mining, Anki export, and smart filtering using Google Apps Script.

📥 All decks can also be downloaded as `.tsv` files from the `/decks` folder and imported directly into **Anki** or any other SRS tool that supports tab-separated values.

No clutter. No noise. Just progress.

- This helps you visualize your learning progress by filtering or calculating known vs. unknown words.
